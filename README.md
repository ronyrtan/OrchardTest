Repo for Orchard Interface Development Test

Reasoning for using vanilla CSS:
- I used vanilla CSS for this project as I wanted to demonstrate my solid foundation and knowledge in CSS. 
- When developing a site based off an interface design, being able to create and customise styles from scratch is more efficient than tweaking styling frameworks to fit the design.
- For a simpler project of this size I did not think it was worth the additional size and load of using Bootstrap.
